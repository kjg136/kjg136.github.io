I am an Assistant Research Scientist at the Unversity of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC, GESTAR II) and NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). My primary research interests are in data assimilation and inverse problems, with a particular focus on applications to the Earth's main magnetic field. I'm interested in both short-term variations (years to decades) of the field as well as events on longer timescales, such as reversals and major excursions. In regards to shorter timescales, I'm specifically interested in developing data assimilation methodologies for core-state estimation and decadal-scale geomagnetic forecasting.
