I am a NASA Postdoctoral Fellow (NPP) at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. My current research focuses on predictability in the Earth's main magnetic field. I'm interested in both the secular variation of the field as well as events on longer timescales, such as reversals and major excursions. In regards to shorter timescales, I'm specifically interested in the numerics of data assimilation for decadal-scale geomagnetic forecasting. This work is done under the supervision of Dr. Weijia Kuang.
