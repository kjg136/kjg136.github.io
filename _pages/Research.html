<h2>Threshold-based predictions of the Earth’s axial magnetic dipole field</h2>

We study predictions of reversals of Earth’s axial magnetic dipole field that are 
based solely on the dipole’s intensity. The prediction strategy is, roughly, that once 
the dipole intensity drops below a threshold, then the field will continue to decrease 
and a reversal (or a major excursion) will occur. Below you will find a collection of 
slides discussing this study along with a short video introducing them.

<h2>Data assimilation for decadal-scale geomagnetic forecasting</h2>

There has been growing interest in using data assimilation (DA) with numerical geodynamo 
models to better understand the processes of the Earth's deep interior and improve decadal-scale 
forecasting of the magnetic field. There remain several fundamental questions regarding the 
application of DA in geomagnetism. Progress in DA in other sciences is in part attributable to 
the availability of relevant simplified models, such as the Lorenz models, that can be used to test the 
various aspects of a DA system. With the success of this approach in mind, we have created a new, 
simplified model that couples a chaotic flow to an induction equation. This model is designed so 
that computations are orders of magnitude less expensive than computations with a 3D geodynamo model. 
For this reason, the simplified model can be used as a computationally effective test-bed for 
approaches to geomagnetic DA. Below is a presentation on this work from the 2020 SIAM-Mathematics of 
Planet Earth conference. An article discussing this presentation can be found
