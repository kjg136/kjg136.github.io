<h2>Threshold-based predictions of the Earth’s axial magnetic dipole field</h2>

We study predictions of reversals of Earth’s axial magnetic dipole field that are 
based solely on the dipole’s intensity. The prediction strategy is, roughly, that once 
the dipole intensity drops below a threshold, then the field will continue to decrease 
and a reversal (or a major excursion) will occur.
